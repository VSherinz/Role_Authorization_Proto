Hard Dependency
1. Node JS
2. NPM
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Brief Description: This is a little overengineered implementation that solves the question provided by MoneyLion

GET /feature?email=XXX&featureName=XXX
This endpoint receives email (userâ€™s email) and featureName as request parameters and
returns the following response in JSON format.
Example Response:
{
"canAccess": true|false (will be true if the user has access to the featureName)
}

POST /feature
This endpoint receives the following request in JSON format and returns an empty
response with HTTP Status OK (200) when the database is updated successfully, otherwise
returns Http Status Not Modified (304).
Example Request:
{
"featureName": "xxx", (string)
"email": "xxx", (string) (user's name)
"enable": true|false (boolean) (uses true to enable a user's access, otherwise
}

Instruction
1. NPM Install - Trigger installation of dependency as specified in package.json
2. node main.js - Start the server with ports specified in main.js, consider change the port if 8080 is used by other service
3. Export postman.json into postman collection - Postman is being used to test validity of endpoint to meet expectation of the question
4. There will be 3 Endpoint Folder in Postman Collection (Feature, User and User Feature)
5. Run create table for each endpoint
6. Run create data for each endpoint (Feature, followed by user and lastly user feature)
7. Run isUserRoleEnable (Q1) for answer of Q1
8. Run Switch IsEnable of User Role (Q2) for answer of Q2
9. The rest of endpoint is just optional


Ways to improve
1. Adding interceptor so that error handling code could be reused
2. Typescript conversion and application of Generics
